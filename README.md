# ALS-WR Tutorial Repository

This repo holds the original notebook from [an excellent tutorial](http://online.cambridgecoding.com/notebooks/mhaller/predicting-user-preferences-in-python-using-alternating-least-squares) on the Alternating Least Squares with Weighted-Î»-Regularization method, as well as a modified version where I compare the original computation with a dramatically sped-up version (~100x) that takes advantage of the sparsity while doing the same math.

Check out [my blog post](http://www.benjlindsay.com/blog/taking-advantage-of-sparsity-in-als-wr-algorithm/) for more details.
